## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Federico, a Ph.D. candidate in Data Science at Sapienza University, Rome, and a researcher at the CENTAI Institute.
My research focuses on modeling, detecting, and mitigating harmful phenomena on social media, including polarization, echo chambers, and coordinated campaigns.

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring innovative methods to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) using social reinforcement learning, where reward mechanisms are influenced by stochastic dynamic processes on graphs. My work also investigates how LLMs leverage internal concepts for unsupervised tasks, optimize opinion dynamics within the FJ model, and detect coordinated inauthentic behavior across multiple platforms.

Exciting newsâ€”Iâ€™m set to graduate in May 2025!
